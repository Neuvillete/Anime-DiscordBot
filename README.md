# Anime/Manga Search Query Generator

This project provides a simple function to generate a GraphQL query for searching anime, manga, characters, or studios using the Anilist API.

## Usage

The main function `search_by_title(command)` returns a GraphQL query string based on the provided command. Here's how to use it:

```
from your_module import search_by_title

# Example command can be 'anime', 'manga', 'character', or 'studio'
query = search_by_title('anime')
```

This query can be used with GraphQL requests to the Anilist API. Example usage:

```python
import requests

url = 'https://graphql.anilist.co'
variables = {
    'search': 'Your search title',
    'type': 'ANIME'  # or 'MANGA', 'CHARACTER', 'STUDIO'
}

response = requests.post(url, json={'query': query, 'variables': variables})
data = response.json()
```

Here's a complete example demonstrating how to use the `search_by_title` function and handle the API response:

```python
import requests

from your_module import search_by_title

# Define the search type and term
search_type = 'anime'  # or 'manga', 'character', 'studio'
search_term = 'Naruto'

# Generate the query
query = search_by_title(search_type)

# Define the request URL and variables
url = 'https://graphql.anilist.co'
variables = {
    'search': search_term,
    'type': search_type.upper()
}

# Send the request to the Anilist API
response = requests.post(url, json={'query': query, 'variables': variables})

# Handle the API response
if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    print(data)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")

```

## Note

This function generates a query string only. You need to use it with appropriate GraphQL request handling to fetch data from the Anilist API.
